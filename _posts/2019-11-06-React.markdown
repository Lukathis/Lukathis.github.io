* What's the difference between different licenses? e.g. MIT and so on

* What is JSX?
A. An XML-like syntax.

* Cannot understand sample _"A Stateful Component"_ in reactjs.org, where it defined tick per sec?
A. The method componentDidMount() defines the interval as 1000 which is 1 second. And seems that this.interval is an internal field of React.Component.
