Different learning styles: theoretical/practical. Was always learning by concepts, and this time planned to learn by doing and grab concepts when taking metro. Learning curve is another magic thing, different people have different opinion on this. When learning React, need to measure it.

# Questions and answers

* What is React?
A. React is a library for building user interfaces.

* What is React component?
> 一个组件的渲染函数就是一个基于 state 和 props 的纯函数，state 是自己的，props 是外面来的，任何东西变了就重新渲染一遍.

* What's node and React Native mentioned in React's Readme: _"React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native._"

* What does it mean _"Add React to a Website as a <script> tag in one minute"_

* What's the difference between different licenses? e.g. MIT and so on

* What is JSX?
A. An XML-like syntax.

* Cannot understand sample _"A Stateful Component"_ in reactjs.org, where it defined tick per sec?
A. The method componentDidMount() defines the interval as 1000 which is 1 second. And seems that this.interval is an internal field of React.Component.

* What is react hook?

* What is Babel?
A. Babel is a JavaScript compiler. It is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.
