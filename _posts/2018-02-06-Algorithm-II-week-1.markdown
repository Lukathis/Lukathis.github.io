# General

## Graph:
 * Directed graph
 * Undirected graph

## Concepts
 * Vertices. 点
 * Edge. 边
 * Path. Sequence of vertices connected by edges.
 * Cycle. Path whose first and last vertices are the same

 Two vertices are connected if there is a path between them.

 ## Some graph-processing problems

 * Path. Is there a path between s and t?
 * Shortest path. What is the shortest path between s and t?
 * Cycle. Is there a cycle in the graph?
 * Euler tour. Is there a cycle that uses each edge exactly once?
 * Hamilton tour. Is there a cycle that uses each vertex exactly once?
