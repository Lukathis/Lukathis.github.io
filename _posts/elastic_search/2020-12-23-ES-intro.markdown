Elasticsearch提供了一种在非结构化数据中进行分析的有力工具。

# Getting started

## Basic concepts

NRT
Cluster 
Node
Index
Document
Shards and Replicas

## Data

Query DSL
* _source: similar to "SELECT FROM COL1, COL2"
* match_all: where clause
* sort: DESC/AESC
* bool query: AND/OR/NOT in SQL
* size: TOP/FETCH FIRST 
* score: evaluate that how relavant the field is, the higher the better matched
* range: criteria1 <= FIELD <= criteria2
* aggregation: just like GROUP BY etc. Can be nested.

```sql
GET /bank/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "group_by_state": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "state.keyword"
      }
    }
  }
}

SELECT state, COUNT(*) FROM bank GROUP BY state ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
```

# Setup Elasticsearch

**FYI. MY COMPUTER SUCKS AND I COULD NOT DEMO WHILE STREAMING**

* JVM > 1.8.0_131
* Brew will be fine

# API Conventionis

## Date math sample

Searches the Logstash indices for the past three days

```LOL
# GET /<logstash-{now/d-2d}>,<logstash-{now/d-1d}>,<logstash-{now/d}>/_search
GET /%3Clogstash-%7Bnow%2Fd-2d%7D%3E%2C%3Clogstash-%7Bnow%2Fd-1d%7D%3E%2C%3Clogstash-%7Bnow%2Fd%7D%3E/_search
{
  "query" : {
    "match": {
      "test": "data"
    }
  }
}
```

## Access control

Specified in elasticsearch.yml file

```yaml
rest.action.multi.allow_explicit_index: false
```


# Documents

Write model
* Replication group - primary shard vs replica shards
* in-sync copies: available copies

Read model
* coordinating node


* Versioning
* Operation type: op_type
* Routing
* timeout


# Misc

* NDJSON: Newline Delimited JSON
* Apache Lucene
