<p>## Some graph-processing problems</p>

<ul>
  <li>Path. Is there a path between s and t?</li>
  <li>Shortest path. What is the shortest path between s and t?</li>
  <li>Cycle. Is there a cycle in the graph?</li>
  <li>Euler tour. Is there a cycle that uses each edge exactly once?</li>
  <li>Hamilton tour. Is there a cycle that uses each vertex exactly once?</li>
</ul>
